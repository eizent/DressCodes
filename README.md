# Dress Codes in Schools
## Proposed Research Question
How does the establishment of dress codes in schools reflect and reproduce gender roles though fashion ideologies?

## Context
Dress codes in school were established to prevent students from wearing inappropriate clothing to school, and thereby promoting a safe, 'disciplined' image. However, who decides what is deemed appropriate or inappropriate? There is debate that dress codes (and the enforcement of dress codes) actually dispropotionalty target girls, students of color, and LGBTQ+ students (Pendharkar 2022). Additionally, the notion and assumption of dress codes position girls as "irresponsible, deviant, and in need of help," enforcing oppressive and rigid gender norms (Pomerantz 2006). I want to examine to what extent these notions are visible and/or implied within institutions that require dress codes.

## How to study? 
In order to begin answering the research question, I want to look at what types of clothing or accessories are banned or other restrictions within dress codes. Additionally, I would want to focus on which gendered items are banned more often and students who have more dress code violations within school (for example, if girls have more violations/more severe punishments then boys). Finally, information that looks at students and school staff members attitudes towards dress codes.

## Tools and Methods Required
For this project, I think data visualization of graphs and charts that are color coded with regards to gender would be a good way to present data found. Statistical analysis could also be useful. 

### Proposed Dataset 
So far, I have found one dataset that relates to my topic-- it includes names of USA high schools and lists clothing and accessories that have been banned by the school. I have included the data in this repository. Source Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/dress-code-regulations-in-us-high-schools
